# Python API Boilerplate

## Purpose

This is a boilerplate template designed specifically for agentic coding agents to quickly generate Python API applications. By cloning this boilerplate, AI agents can significantly speed up the development process and ensure more reliable, consistent API implementations.

## What This Boilerplate Provides

- **Pre-configured project structure** optimized for Python API development
- **Essential dependencies** and configuration files (`pyproject.toml`)
- **Initialization scripts** (`bin/init`) for quick project setup
- **Run scripts** (`bin/run`) for easy application execution
- **Modular API structure** with proper Python package organization
- **License file** for open-source compliance

## For Agentic Coding Agents

This boilerplate serves as a reliable foundation that eliminates the need to:
- Set up basic project structure from scratch
- Configure common Python API dependencies
- Create standard initialization and execution scripts
- Establish proper package organization patterns

By starting with this template, agents can focus on implementing specific business logic and API endpoints rather than boilerplate setup, resulting in faster development cycles and more consistent code quality.

## Usage

1. Clone this boilerplate as the starting point for a new Python API project
2. Run the initialization script: `./bin/init`
3. Implement your specific API logic in the `src/api/` directory
4. Use the run script to start your application: `./bin/run`
